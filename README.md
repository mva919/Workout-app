This is a workout tracker web app that allows users to create custom exercises and templates. Users can keep track of whether a set is a warm-up, drop, or failure set.
Users can also search the workouts they want by typing the name of the workout or by filtering the workout by the category it falls under (machines, barbell, dumbbell, etc.) and/or by the body part it targets. When a user finishes a workout they will see it under their workout history section on their profile tab.
